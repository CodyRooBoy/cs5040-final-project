### Creating and Configuring Python Environment
For the best results with the Jupyter Notebooks, please set up a virtual Python environment using `venv` and install the Python packages found in `requirements.txt`.

```bash
python -m venv env

# Activate the virtual environment (on Linux)
source env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
